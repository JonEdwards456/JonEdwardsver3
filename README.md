I have been working on another project on cratejoy.com, please follow this link to view my store! 
https://designsbyjonedwards.cratejoy.com/

I added some animated effects using animate.css and a little Javascript! Please hover over the various header elements such as the logo, buttons, or the h1 element to see!


My new hand coded responsive website, go to this link to preview.

(some features will not work without install) This is a work in progress, check back for updates. 

I have used help from many sources around the web to create this project, including TeamTreehouse.com, Jssor slider, stackoverflow, CSSTricks, animate.css, and many others. 

Contact me with any questions!
